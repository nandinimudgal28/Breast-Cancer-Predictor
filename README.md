#  Breast Cancer Tumor Classification - ML & Deep Learning Based Predictor

This project implements a robust Breast Cancer Prediction system using both **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** techniques to classify tumors as **Benign (non-cancerous)** or **Malignant (cancerous)** using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset**.

## 📌 Project Highlights

-  **10-feature selection** based on Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and SHAP importance
-  Compared multiple ML models: SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
-  Achieved high accuracy and AUC using deep learning (Keras + TensorFlow)
-  Visualized model interpretability using SHAP, heatmaps, and confusion matrices
-  Built a real-time **prediction interface using Streamlit**
-  Integrated into a local **VS Code deployment environment**
-  Final model and scaler saved via `joblib` for production use

## 🧪 SHAP & Feature Engineering

- Used SHAP to interpret predictions
- Created new features like:
  - `area_to_radius = area_mean / radius_mean`
  - `symmetry_change = symmetry_worst - symmetry_mean`
- Performed correlation analysis and removed redundant features

## 🚀 Streamlit Web App

- Collects user input for 10 top features
- Predicts class with **probability breakdown**
- Displays intuitive outputs:  
  - 🟢 Benign or 🔴 Malignant  
  - Confidence score in %
- Run locally via:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
